# Tantive Star Wars

Tantive is a Star Wars fan site, where a user can view and favourite characters from each Star Wars movie that exists. This was a week long group project intended for us to get a deeper understanding of how React works, learn how to use React-Router, and become better at testing and fetching with React.
